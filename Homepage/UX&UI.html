    <h2>Project Site Plan/Specification</h2>
    <p>The website elevatechurch.com is the website for Elevate Church in Milan. The website’s
    mission statement is to inform the public about the church itself and how the site visitor
    can become involved. The intended audience is Milan and the surrounding community, such as
    Bradford, Medina, and Humboldt. To measure the website’s success, I can check the site’s
    traffic and see how many people visited the website’s pages. To track user satisfaction, a
    pop-up can be included asking the user questions such as, “Are you finding what you need?”
    or, “How helpful is our website?” One issue in developing the website will be my own lack
    of experience, but another issue could be bringing attention to the website and getting
    people not involved in the church already to visit the site.</p>
