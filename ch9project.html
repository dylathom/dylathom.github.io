<h1>Chapter 9 Hands-On Project #4</h1>
<p>The website I found for this project was Walmart.com. The navigation design is very
elaborate, and because of its complexity I find it very effective and tidy. There are almost
three different navigation bars within the main navigation bar: one of them groups together
online features such as finding the closest store and tracking your online orders, another
groups together the goods by department ranging from maintenance to fitness, and the last
groups togther other features such as a registry page and a help page. Anything that you
could need to search for should be found under one of the many pages within walmart.com's
navigation bar. Although from first glance it looks like a lot of pages, it is very simple
to find whatever it is that you need thanks to the thoroughness of the navigation bar.</p>
<ol type="a">
    <li>Are the linking text and images meaningful? Yes, each name within the navigation bar
    will take you to a page that shows just what it says.</li>
    <li>Is it easy to access the site's features? Yes, again there are a lot of pages but
    it is very simple to walk through.</li>
    <li>Can you easily search for content? Yes, if you have trouble finding what you need
    in the nav bar, then you can use the search bar at the top of the site.</li>
    <li>Is there a site map or other site-orienting feature? No, I could not find an
    avaliable site map to use, but I do not think you would need one due to the detailed
    navigation bar.</li>
</ol>
